|  *Custer and Crazy Horse*, Stephen Ambrose<br/> | 11/06/24<br/> | 💛: what an epic story. The account of the last stand almost brought a tear to my eye (blimey, hope no-one else ever reads this. Lame!). Apparently he went down laughing, much like Picard in the sixth season episode, “Tapestry”. Anyway. Made all the better for reading along with the Rest is History’s podcast series on Custer. I may have to plan future history reading around such podcasts!<br/> |
|  *Slow Productivity, *Cal Newport<br/> | 16/06/24<br/> | 👍: a bit of a tepid thumbs up, mainly because I feel like I read this all before, because I have. This is basically a “greatest hits” of what he has already gone over many times on his podcast and his blog. See  for a summary.<br/> |

|  Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl <br/> | 14/06/24<br/> | 💛: it’s still got it! And I still think it deserves to be up there with my favourite games of all time. Playing on console was actually fine - better than I expected. I suppose my only criticism is that it is a game where you really need to be able to pull off headshots, and that is difficult with a controller rather than a mouse. So I used a lot of ammo, a lot of medkits etc, and, of course, a lot of quickloads. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed revisiting this. I don’t particularly feel the need to carry on and play Clear Sky or Call of Pripyat though.<br/> |
|  MDK<br/> | 15/06/24<br/> | 👍: the main criticism this got at the time was that it only had six levels. And yep, I completed it in under four hours. I think James Flynn’s review in PCG (link below) was a tad hyperbolic: “a work of genius”? Perhaps not - the basic gunplay is very repetitive. However, what does stand out are the amazing (at the time) graphics, art design, originality of concept, soundtrack, and so on. It is a very well put together package, which makes the fact it was developed in only a year even more remarkable!<br/> |
