        <td><p>Continuing the Games Workshop theme, this is the story of Games Workshop's founding in the 1970s. Told primarily by Ian Livingston (although Steve Jackson adds some content here and there), it only covers up until the point that they sold it off (late 80s, just around the time Warhammer 40,000 began production). It is a short read, with lots of pages dedicated to photography, so really fun to zap through. So many interesting snippets about early-GW, back in the days when they were really just a Dungeons & Dragons retailer. Basically, they had a lot of fun. They really were/are the kind of bastards who enjoy what they do for a living, rather than trudging through the day praying for the end. Selling games by day, playing games by night. <p>Mr Livingstone, having sold GW for a billion quid (not literally, although GW is now literally worth billions - fuck) went on to do shit like sell a bucket-load of Fighting Fantasy novels, and join Eidos and get shit like Tomb Raider and Deus Ex published. I mean - fuck. What a life. How is he not a Sir? *Checks* Oh, he is. SIR IAN LIVINGSTONE! But only last year, and for "services to online gaming"? That's like knighting Ian McKellan for services to selling drinks.<hr>

        <p>YES! <strong>SPOILERS!</strong> Another excellent White Scars novel by Chris Wraight, essentially the second part of the "Scars Duology". Duology isn't a word? It is now, motherfucker! So yes, basically if the first book was about the White Scars deciding they had better join the fight against Horus, this book was them then doing that. Things get a bit hairy but they, yes, SPOILERS! (i've warned you) managed to score some pretty good victories against the Death Guard, and, just as they are about to get completely shat on by a huge combined Death Guard / Emperor's Children fleet, unlock one of them there secret webway portal things back to Earth to join the forthcoming last stand. The last stand that has been brewing for 30-something books at this point. And is the subject of an entirely new book series.<p>That's right, not content with dedicating almost sixty books on the subject of the Horus Heresy (which I am only reading some of - life is short and all that), Games Workshop have started again with a series called "The Siege of Terra" about the... siege of Terra (natch). At my current rate, I expect to begin that series at some point in 2024. The good news is it looks they are only planning around 10 books for that, rather than around 60. What will they do then? My bet is they will start again with a "re-tread" of the Horus Heresy. Because the first Horus Heresy book is almost 20 years old at this point. Definitely needs re-writing. That shit is ancient. Like me.

          This is one of those books that, like, oh my god, everyone is talking about. It is very well written and concise, which I like. I also like how it is free of a lot of the self-help "you can do it, oh my god, you go hero, yeah baby, wave that flag, love yourself, yee-haw" stuff that you can find in some other books of the same genre. IT is very practical, I guess is what I am saying. Do X, because of Y, and you should hopefully find that Z. Each chapter goes through some concrete techniques, the ultimate aim of which will be to make you into less of a slob.
          <p>As always, I am not sure if I will actually implement more than about 5% of this into my life. Although as he makes very clear in the book, even small changes to your routines can make a huge difference over the long-term. One example: environmental cues. Change up your surroundings to help encourage better habits. So, if you want to drink less, don't routinely have beer in your fridge. Put it in there when you want one. If you still want one by the time it is cold, go ahead and drink it! Yee-haw, baby!</p>

          This went over A LOT of ground for such a shortish book. Enjoyable. Basically summarised the IBM book I read earlier this year in the space of a chapter, then also summarised that book about Steve Jobs I read a couple of years ago in the space of another chapter, and that book about Bill Gates in another chapter. And also covered Amstrads, Spectrums, BBC Micros, the birth of the internet. Still quite technical in places but I enjoyed being bamboozled by tech stuff rather than trying to remember the name of every executive in IBM in the 1980s.

          <h4>Scars (2014)</h4><strong>SPOILERS!</strong> This was great. GREAT! Could Chris Wraight be another Dan Abnett in the making? Or is it just that the White Scars are such a cool chapter? If the Space Wolves are Space Vikings then the White Scars are Space Mongols. They have quirks like “no dreadnoughts” and “they retreat a lot… on purpose”. And they don’t even know the Horus Heresy has broken out for ages because they are having too much fun killing Orks. Anyway, a cracking yarn. The Scars, it turns out, are basically the best hope for humanity, when you consider that the Blood Angels, Ultramarines and Dark Angels are all trapped together in a different part of the galaxy (thanks to LORGAR’s EVIL WARP STORM THING); the Raven Guard, Iron Hands and Salamanders are basically all dead; and the Imperial Fists and Space Wolves are busy shoring up Terra. That just leaves the Scars to actually try and slow Horus down. Wild. WILD.

          Love it, love it, love it. I mean, I guess maybe I’d give it a 4.5 but I don’t do halves. I imagined I was Jean-Luc Picard the whole time I was reading it. Some of the language is very “of its time” and by that I don’t mean racist. I mean using vocabulary that I don’t recognise and have to go and look up. But you know, it’s not Shakespeare is it? It’s only 100 years old. 90, really. It was just one long wild ride. I use the phrase wild ride too much. Anyway, Philip Marlow ace detective really is quite an ace detective. I guess my only criticism is that he makes some amazing leaps of logic that turn out to be correct but is that more my fault for being a tumbling dickweed?

          <h4>Big Blues: the Unmaking of IBM (1994)</h4>3 stars is a maybe a tad harsh, but it was a bit plodding. Nonetheless, very interesting. I just love hoovering up all the incidental details in these accounts of 80s tech companies. It was hard to keep up with all the different names (how many different managers did IBM have during this period?). But anyway, I learnt a lot about the history of IBM, and in particular, the period from the early 80s to the early 90s where they managed to cram in a lot of high highs and low lows. One day, I’d love to play around on the original PC. But I may have to content myself with an LGR Youtube video about it.

          <h4>Angels of Caliban (2016)</h4><strong>SPOILERS!</strong> I found this one a bit of a chore at times, because there was so much background fluff I either didn’t remember from the earlier Dark Angel books, or that came from various novellas and audiobooks that I have never read/heard to begin with. This can be a downside of following an abbreviated reading list, but - come on, who has read ALL the novellas? Come on. Anyway, the bits that were not set on Caliban (which is a bit dull) were still pretty good. And they are the main reason I read this one. It’s set on Ultramar and deals with the collapse of the mini-Imperium-Secundus thing. Main takeaway is that Lion El’Johnson is a bit of a surly “douche”.

          <h4>The Moral Landscape (2010)</h4>
          <p>The central thesis is that our morals and ethics should be guided by one overriding objective: to reduce suffering. Seems reasonable, and I was quite persuaded. But this being a Sam Harris book, he went meandering off down all sorts of interesting ginnels of tangential intellectual extravaganza.</p>Zero-context quote:
          <blockquote>
            As Kahneman admits, the vast majority of our experiences in life never get recalled, and the time we spend actually remembering the past is comparatively brief. Thus, the quality of most of our lives can be assessed only in terms of whatever fleeting character it has as it occurs. But this includes the time we spend recalling the past. Amid this flux, the moments in which we construct a larger story about our lives appear like glints of sunlight on a dark river: they may seem special, but they are part of the current all the same.
