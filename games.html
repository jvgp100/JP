<h2>Some thoughts on this year's crop</h2>
Let's start with <b>the Silent Hill series</b>, shall we? As for the first game, <b>Silent Hill 1</b>,well: I do love the #PS1 horror games, though by that I really mean Resident Evil games. This was my first time playing Silent Hill. I appreciate what makes this a classic, but think I prefer the zombies (rather than weird ghoul thingies), pre-rendered backdrops (rather than ugly 3D terrain) and insanely cheesy dialogue (rather than slightly incoherent dialogue) of RE vs SH. </p>
<p> Still, I had fun. What about <b>Silent Hill 2</b>? I’d say it’s pretty much the ultimate sequel - improving on the original in basically every aspect. Better graphics (obv), better story, etc.

Some people do prefer the original as a pure “horror” experience, and I think I’d agree this one is more psychological creeps than out-and-out “argh!”. But it is unsettling right from the get-go in that now iconic scenic viewpoint. Glad I finally got around to playing. </p>
<p>Now… on to <b>Silent Hill 3?</b> Listen, mate. This was good. I think it beats 2 even in some respects - it is more out and out horror but does that very well, with some superbly creepy levels. The mall, the construction site in particular. But yeah. It’s more frenetic and in your face than 2, that’s for sure. Doesn’t ever really let up. Maybe the end dragged a bit but overall, I was happy. Proper creepy-ass shiznat.</p>
<p>But as for <b>Silent Hill 4</b>... well, well, this was the odd one out. The biggest shift away from the template so far. The central conceit of “the Room” is, of course, brilliant. The problem is that it has all these niggles the other games didn’t have: 1) invincible enemies that follow you around 2) limited inventory space 3) requiring arduous backtracking 4) it goes on a few hours longer than the rest (or felt that way…), backtracking over several previous levels, but this time escorting a woman in a cocktail dress. I resorted to using a walkthrough to get it over with. Stil, the central idea is sound. 
<p> Check back soon for some more insights on... THIS YEAR'S CROP.
