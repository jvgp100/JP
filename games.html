          <h4>Disco Elysium (2019)</h4>This was excellent. This is proof that I do acknowledge that games made after 2010 exist (though I still deny that Star Wars films made after 1983 exist. WEIRD?). No doubt this is far older than I think. I'd best look it up, to maintain my journalistic integrity. [Some time passes]. 2019? Pre-Covid? Bloody hellfire.

It's a <i>very</i> original point and click adventure game. You play a drunk cop trying to somehow solve a murder, despite being drunk. Basically. Anyway, as you can imagine, it's pretty damn hilarious. A bit like a modern Sam & Max Hit the Road but with fewer animals. And with a lot more freedom. Some mild RPG elements as well (there's a lot of dice rolling to determine whether you successfully kick doors down and so on). So maybe Sam & Max hits Baldurs Gate.<p> It does seem to have a lot of replayability. This time, I played as an intelligent, centrist-dad style do-gooder, trying his best to avoid hitting the booze for long enough to do some detective work.
          <p>Next time I play it I have to try being a stupid, fascist, bastard, who is also a drunk detective (I don't think you get to pick the drunk detective bit. But you can definitely choose to be stupid, and choose to be fascist).

          Played in January 2023. Took me just under 20 hours.

          <h4>Descent (1995)</h4>So, my agreement with myself is that if I can tell something isn’t going to be a corker (or at least, something I can plough through quickly without wanting to top myself) I can abandon it on the “life’s too short” principle. Playing games is meant to be fun, after all. <p>And lo! Descent clearly falls into the “hasn’t aged well” bucket. Which is what a lot of retro-haters seem to think applies to all games over 5 years’ old. But they are clearly nincompoops. There are an infinite variety of amazing old games. But this ain’t one of them. It’s like Doom with proper 3D movement. But without interesting level design, with crap weapons, crap enemies, etc. Every level is basically the same. Plus it’s really aggravatingly difficult! <p>The menu music and intro music are good, though. I can recommend playing just the first level. That gets you some great music, a great intro sequence, and about 5-10 minutes of gameplay, which is more than enough. You may think that makes 2 stars sound generous. And I guess you're right. But that menu music really is top notch.

          <h4>Baldur's Gate (1999)</h4>Mate, mate. Really enjoyed this one actually. Can’t believe it took me, ooo, a quarter of a century to get around to it. Enhanced Edition makes it nice and simple to get going, and, unlike teenage John, this time I actually spent ten minutes learning what THAC0 means.<p> So, better prepared, I dived in and YEAH it’s a classic high fantasy fun fest for the first half. Hits all those notes. Lush forests full of gnolls. Annoying Elves you just want to slap. Fireballs. You know the score. <p> Drags a bit in the second half but, you know. Easy 4 stars. I will carry on with BG2 later this year and hopefully complete that too. Finishing a journey that began in Will’s bedroom on George Road. You had to be there. But if you weren't, basically, Will spent 4 hours installing Baldur's Gate off 4 CDs then got bored before the end of the tutorial area. Which is easy to understand really. It takes about 20 years before you "get the hang of it", evidently. But also, I have secret weapons that neither he nor I had 20 years ago. Such as an understanding of THAC0. Oh and also, "Google". Quite useful when you don't know what to do or where to go or where to find an overpowered two-handed axe.

          <h4>Call of Juarez (2006)</h4>I must be getting old, or impatient. Because I went into this expecting to be as awestruck as I was in 2006. I love a good western. I love deserts. I love cowboys. I mean, come on - who doesn't? But, despite all the positives, the problem is that the ACTUAL GAMEPLAY KIND OF SUCKS. The guns are just piddly. They're like "piow-piow" and then either you die or the other guy dies and you're like "gosh-dang it, sonny". The slow-draw pistol stuff is just janky. The stealth sections are just annoying (see screenshot). Remember what I said about Return to Castle Wolfenstein when I played that in 2022? If you're not Mark, you won't remember. But, it's a bit like that. I remembered all the good bits but forgot the fact the actual shooting (and this is still a first-person shooter at the end of the day) was naff.<p>On the plus side, though, yes, it does still have all those good bits that aren't the shooting bits. It has some great trees. The music was actually as epic as I remembered (you should search on Youtube for 'Call of Juarez menu theme' and prepare... to be... amazed). The voice acting is superb. The hills! THE HILLS! The trees. Did I mention them? What I really want is just this engine with the shooting and with more of the bits in between the shooting, when you are just walking or riding on horseback across the amazing landscape. Listening to that amazing soundtrack. But then within a minute or two some dick starts shooting at you. Can some clever so-and-so do a mod for this which takes out all the combat? Thanks.
