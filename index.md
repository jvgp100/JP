# Doom 3

17/01/25

Scary. I played this on my Mac Mini M2 (the ultimate* gaming machine). But how? While it was released natively on Mac, that old version won’t work these days, and in any event, GoG only sell the Windows version.

Luckily, the superb dhewm3.org source port came to the rescue. Using this, it should be a doddle to set up on just about any OS you can think of (even FreeBSD, apparently).

Note that dhwem3 recreates the original 2004 edition (yes, this game is over 20 years old), not the later BFG release. Which is just as well, because if you ask me, the BFG version kinda missed the point. Doom 3 is a horror game, using John Carmack’s fancy id Tech 4 to great effect. Here come’s the science part! 

> “The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time” (thanks, Wikipedia).

In BFG not only can you can attach your torch to your gun, lighting everything in front of you up perfectly, but they actually upped the brightness of the entire game, rendering the whole thing about 50% less scary.  

Anyway, why am I moaning about that? I played the original version! The verdict? Fun, although it does outstay its welcome a bit. Probably could have been about 2/3 of the length, as it does get a tad repetitive. But it was fun to revisit, and awaken memories of playing it for the first time in the summer holidays between my first and second years at university. 

It’s also a reminder of just how fast tech moved on back in those days. As I said, this game is now over 20 years old, but still looks pretty good (fine, it won’t pass for a 2025 game, but come on), whereas Doom 2 was only just about to hit its 10th anniversary when this came out. Crazy. Crazy, I tell you.
