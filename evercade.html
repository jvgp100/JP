<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Right, well, by 'resources' I really mean, a link to <a href="https://evercade.info">Evercade Info Central</a>. The best Evercade site around, it has the following pages of interest and utility to all existing and aspiring Evercaders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://evercade.info/evercade-carts-manuals/">list of all the cartridges</a> and scans of their original manuals.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://evercade.info/evercade-games-database/">database</a> of all the available games.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://evercade.info/evercade-games-breakdown/">fascinating pie chart</a> breaking down how many games from each platform are available. At time of writing, the NES is the winner with 21%! Wowzers.</li>

<h3>Console</h3>
<h4>22. Bitmap Brothers collection</h4>
<P>So, the Bitmap Brothers. Yes, them. Surely one of the original 'rockstar' development houses, their glory days were in the early 90s on the Amiga. But, this being a console collection, this is an assortment of Master System / Mega Drive / SNES / PS1 stuff.
  <p<b>Highlight(s)?</b> Well, it has to be the Chaos Engine. This is a top-down arcade-style shooter. It's hard as balls, but has amazing music and an ahead-of-its-time steampunk art-style that really suits the whole vibe, man. Even better with two players.
<p><b>What about the rest?</b> Speedball 2: HD is a similarly iconic game that people "raved about" back in the day. Basically futuristic ice hockey, sort of. Needs two players even more than the Chaos Engine, though. Playing against AI gets old, fast. We also have Speedball (the original) on Master System, which is like Speedball 2 but clunkier and jankier. Then there's Speedball 2100 on PS1, which is like Speedball 2 but less charming. Then there's Xenon 2, which is an okay-ish SHMUP. But there are better examples elsewhere on Evercade (especially the Arcade collections), so you won't want to spend much time with it. 
<p><b>Will I pick it up again?</b> Yes, I reckon so - but maybe only if I have friends round. The best games on here (Speedball 2 and Chaos Engine) are both immeasurably improved by the presence of some "good mates" and perhaps "a cold one".
