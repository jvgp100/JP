<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Right, well, by 'resources' I really mean, a link to <a href="https://evercade.info">Evercade Info Central</a>. The best Evercade site around, it has the following pages of interest and utility to all existing and aspiring Evercaders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://evercade.info/evercade-carts-manuals/">list of all the cartridges</a> and scans of their original manuals.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://evercade.info/evercade-games-database/">database</a>of all the available games.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://evercade.info/evercade-games-breakdown/">fascinating pie chart</a> breaking down how many games from each platform are available. At time of writing, the NES is the winner with 21%! Wowzers.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>My cart reviews</h2>
<h3>22. Bitmap Brothers collection/h3>
<p><b>Will I pick it up again</b>Yes, I reckon so - but maybe only if I have friends round. The best games on here (Speedball 2 and Chaos Engine) are both immeasurably improved by the presence of some "good mates" and perhaps "a cold one".
