## Deus Ex

I replayed Deus Ex... again. And yet again, I had new experiences. To all those who say that surely you've seen everything the game has to offer after the 18th playthrough, I say 'poo to you, with knobs on'. 

This time I went for a new (to me) build, focussing on three weapons: the sawn-off shotgun, the sniper rifle, and the dragon-tooth sword. I had planned on mainly being stealthy (silenced sniper), but having the shotgun as a back-up, with the sword as a general utility weapon for problem-solving and close-range encounters (you know, smashing doors, smashing heads, etc). 

The sniper and the shotgun both ended up being obscenely over-powered, especially once you get your rifle skill to 'Master' level. The sniper rifle can take out cameras and turrets (something I never previously realised... despite having played this game at least 18 times before), and the shotgun can take out almost everything with a shot to the head. 

Thus armed, I once again saved the day, only to then ruin it all by destroying civilisation and insisting that everyone 'live in villages'.
