	<h3>Some of my favourite things to see in York</h3>
    <h4>York's Yummy Chicken</h4>

	<p style="width: 320px">This place's paprika-salted chips are legendary. Or at least, they were legendary in the early to mid 00s. It's still standing, as confirmed by <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/aU1aqMgh1cpcpMLN8">this Google Maps entry.</a> I took the photo in 2014, during what would turn out to be my last but one trip to York. So far.

	<h4>Ah Good the Sea</h4>

	<br>
	<p style="width: 320px">Turns out this graffiti is so famous that it has <a href="https://www.ah-good-the-sea.com">its own website</a>. Anyway, I took this photo in 2018 in what was, as it turned out, my last trip to York. So far. I mean, I probably will go again. I bloody well hope so.
