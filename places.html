<p><img src="yummy.png" width="360" height="240" alt="A yummy chicken"><p>This place&#39;s paprika-salted chips are
legendary. Or at least, they were legendary in the early to mid 00s.
It&#39;s still standing, as confirmed by <a href="a

I took the photo in 2014, during what would turn out to be my last but
one trip to York. So far.</p>

Turns out this graffiti is so famous that it has <a href="a
href=&quot;https://www.ah-good-the-sea.com">its own website</a>. Anyway, I
took this photo in 2018 in what was, as it turned out, my last trip to
York. So far. I mean, I probably will go again. I bloody well hope so. </p>
