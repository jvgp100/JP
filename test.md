## Activity
- [x] 11/08/2024: Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (TV Show)
Season 1 down! I have to say, I definitely found more to enjoy than in previous viewings, or at least this was better than I remembered. Obviously there are a few duds, but the last four in a row were pretty damn solid (to say the least). The Forsaken, Dramatis Personae, Duet and In the Hands of the Prophet. Roll on s2.

PS, I just checked and I started s1 on the 13th of February. Bloody hell! 6 months per season?

üëç: a bit of a tepid thumbs up, mainly because I feel like I read this all before, because I have. This is basically a ‚Äúgreatest hits‚Äù of what he has already gone over many times on his podcast and his blog.

- [x] 05/06/2024: Privateer 2: The Darkening (Video Game)
You know what, I just need to watch the rest of the FMVS on YouTube and be done with it. I had fun, seven hours of fun. But I am now at the point where the difficulty curve has leapt ahead of my abilities to an extent I find aggravating, and the only cure would be more and more grindy trading. But still. CLIVE OWEN!

- [x] 21/05/2024: The Solar War (Book)
- [x] 16/05/2024: Dead Space (Video Game)
Abandoned as, to be honest, I had kind of lost my flow after going on holiday for over a week. It‚Äôs a good game, but certainly quite repetitive after a while, lacking the variety of settings that games like Resident Evil have. A thumbs up, but not a heart.

- [x] 13/05/2024: To Kill A Mockingbird (Book)
- [x] 06/05/2024: Civil War Stories (Book)
- [x] 03/05/2024: The Buried Dagger (Book)

- [x] 27/04/2024: Wisting (TV Show)
Finished series 4. Which is listed as series 3 on iPlayer, just to keep you on your toes. Anyway, we are now up to date, but apparently series 5/4 is in the works - wahey! I think I‚Äôve got Charles hooked on it too.
