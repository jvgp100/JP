# Some of my favourite things to see in York

## York's Yummy Chicken

This place's paprika-salted chips are legendary. Or at least, they were legendary in the early to mid 00s. It's still standing, as confirmed by [this Google Maps entry.](https://goo.gl/maps/aU1aqMgh1cpcpMLN8) I took the photo in 2014, during what would turn out to be my last but one trip to York. So far.

## Ah Good, the Sea

Turns out this graffiti is so famous that it has [its own website](https://www.ah-good-the-sea.com). Anyway, I took this photo in 2018 in what was, as it turned out, my last trip to York. So far. I mean, I probably will go again. I bloody well hope so.
